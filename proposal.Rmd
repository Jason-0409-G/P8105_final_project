## Proposed Title
**Trends and Regional Differences in U.S. Dental Caries Burden and Preventive Service Utilization:  A Combined Analysis of NHANES and California Medi-Cal Data (1999–2023)**

## Motivation
Dental caries remains the most common chronic disease of childhood in the U.S., and progress has been slower among low-income and minority children [@nidcr2022].  
Sealants are highly effective for preventing pit-and-fissure caries, with large reductions in molar cavities reported in the literature [@ng2023].  
We will integrate national oral health prevalence data (NHANES [@nhanes2025]) with California program-level dental utilization data (Medi-Cal [@medical2023]) to examine whether increases in preventive dental service utilization correspond with reductions in caries burden and to quantify COVID-19–related disruption.


## Expected Final Product
- Reproducible R Markdown report with interactive visualizations (GitHub Pages).  
- Statistical and graphical summaries of national caries trends and California preventive-service utilization.  
- Evaluation of COVID-19 disruptions in dental service use.

## Data Sources
1. **NHANES Oral Health Prevalence Estimates (1999–2020)** — Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) [@nhanes2025].  
2. **California Medi-Cal Dental Utilization and Sealant Data (2013–2023)** — California Department of Health Care Services [@medical2023].  
3. **Data dictionary** — official metadata file describing variable definitions.  

All datasets are stored in the `datasets/` folder:  
`nhanes_oral.csv`, `ca_dental.csv`, `ca_dictionary.csv`.




## Planned Analyses
- Harmonize age stages across datasets:  
  Early Childhood (2–5), Childhood (6–9), Adolescence (10–19),  
  Young Adulthood (20–34), Adulthood (35–64), Older Age (65+).  
- **NHANES:** describe time trends in total and untreated caries by age, sex, and race.  
- **Medi-Cal:** analyze preventive and sealant utilization trends (2013–2023) and evaluate COVID-19 interruption using segmented regression.  
- **Ecological analysis:** merge datasets by age stage × year and test correlation between preventive utilization and caries prevalence via weighted least squares (1/SE²).  
- **Visualization:** time-series plots, scatter-regression plots, inequality trends, and ITS diagrams.

**Challenges:** aligning variable definitions, matching age-year windows, and addressing ecological inference limitations.
