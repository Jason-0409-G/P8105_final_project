## Background & Motivation

California’s Medi-Cal program provides dental care to millions of children and adults, yet long-term
trends in utilization and disparities remain poorly understood. Meanwhile, national NHANES
surveillance consistently shows unequal burdens of dental caries across age groups, with pronounced
disease among adolescents and adults.

To understand how service delivery aligns with broader oral health needs, this project integrates:

- **Statewide administrative utilization data from California (2013–2023)**
- **National oral health prevalence estimates from NHANES (1999–2018)**

By combining these complementary data sources, we examine whether increases in preventive dental
service utilization in California correspond to national changes in caries burden, and how trends vary
across age groups, service types, and the COVID-19 disruption.


## Research Objectives

Our analysis addresses the following questions:

1. **California Utilization Trends (2013–2023)**
   - How have overall dental service utilization rates changed over time?
   - How do trends differ across age groups and service categories?
   - Has age-based inequality widened or narrowed?

2. **COVID-19 Impact**
   - Did the pandemic cause measurable disruptions in access to dental care?
   - Can interrupted time-series models detect level or slope changes?

3. **NHANES Caries Burden Trends (1999–2018)**
   - What are the long-term trends in total and untreated caries across age groups?
   - How do disease patterns differ by age and race/ethnicity?

4. **California vs. National Alignment**
   - Do increases in preventive utilization align with declines in untreated caries nationally?
   - How do life-stage utilization patterns compare with life-stage disease burdens?

5. **Additional Analyses**
   - Estimate yearly slopes for each age group to quantify trend intensity.
   - Evaluate cross-sectional patterns across service types (preventive, diagnostic, restorative, sealants).
   - Conduct sensitivity analyses for age-group definitions.


## Expected Outcomes

This project delivers:

- **Comprehensive descriptive visualizations**  
  including age-stratified trends, service-type patterns, inequality gaps, and heatmaps.

- **Statistical models and longitudinal indicators**  
  such as yearly trend slopes and interrupted time-series (ITS) estimates for COVID-19.

- **Integrated interpretation across two datasets**  
  comparing California’s preventive utilization with national caries burden trends.

- **Equity-relevant insights**  
  highlighting life-stage disparities and data limitations.

- **Fully reproducible research workflow**  
  implemented via GitHub, R Markdown, and a published project website.
