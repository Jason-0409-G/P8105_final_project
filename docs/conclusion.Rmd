This project examined statewide dental service utilization patterns in California from 2013 to 2023 and compared these trends with national oral health indicators from NHANES. Our findings highlight both meaningful progress and persistent challenges in achieving equitable access to dental care.


California demonstrated **steady long-term increases in overall and preventive dental service utilization**, particularly among children. Preventive and diagnostic services drove much of this growth, suggesting improvements in early detection and routine care. Despite the pronounced drop in utilization during the COVID-19 pandemic, recovery patterns indicate a return toward the pre-existing upward trajectory.


However, **substantial disparities remain**. Young children exhibit the highest utilization, while infants and older adults consistently have the lowest engagement with dental services. These age-based differences align with national NHANES patterns showing elevated caries burden in adolescents and adults, emphasizing the need for targeted preventive interventions across the life course. NHANES data also reveal persistent racial and ethnic disparities in caries prevalence, underscoring gaps that cannot be directly evaluated in the California dataset due to missing demographic information.


The comparison of utilization and disease burden suggests that improvements in preventive service use may be contributing to broader positive trends in oral health, although the relationship cannot be assessed causally with the available data. The lack of individual-level information and temporal misalignment between datasets further limits the strength of cross-dataset inferences. Nevertheless, taken together, the findings support the conclusion that California’s dental system has expanded access to preventive care in a manner consistent with national oral health needs.


Continued progress will require sustained investment in preventive services, focused efforts to reach underserved age groups, and more comprehensive data collection to evaluate disparities in greater depth. These results provide a foundation for future work aimed at understanding patterns of care, addressing inequities, and improving population oral health outcomes.
