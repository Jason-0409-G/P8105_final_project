Our analysis provides a comprehensive view of dental service utilization patterns in California (2013–2023) and situates these findings within the broader context of national oral health trends reported by NHANES. Several key themes emerge when synthesizing results across datasets.

**1. Long-term improvements alongside persistent disparities**

California shows a clear upward trend in preventive and overall dental service utilization, suggesting expanded access and growing engagement with preventive dental care. This pattern aligns with national declines in untreated caries observed in NHANES, particularly among children and adolescents. Together, these findings point to gradually improving oral health behaviors over the past decade.

However, disparities remain substantial.

* In California, utilization varies sharply across age groups, with young children consistently demonstrating the highest engagement with dental services and older adults showing much lower rates.
* NHANES reveals complementary disparities: adolescents and older adults carry a disproportionate caries burden, and racial/ethnic gaps (e.g., higher prevalence among Mexican American and Non-Hispanic Black youth) remain evident.

Although the two datasets capture different aspects of the dental care continuum (service use vs. disease burden), both highlight the need for targeted interventions in groups that remain underserved.

**2. COVID-19 introduced measurable disruptions**

Both datasets reflect evidence—direct or indirect—of pandemic-related disruption:

* California shows a pronounced drop in 2020 utilization across nearly all service categories, followed by a gradual recovery.
* NHANES does not include 2020, but temporal patterns before and after 2015–2018 indicate instability and slower declines in untreated caries prevalence, consistent with national reports of limited access during the pandemic period.

These findings reinforce broader literature documenting COVID-19's impact on preventive dental care, with potential implications for long-term oral health outcomes.

**3. Service type patterns highlight preventive demand but uneven use**

Our service-specific analyses in California demonstrate:

* **Preventive, exam/evaluation**, and **dental visit** services show the strongest, most consistent growth.
* **Restorative** and **sealant** services remain used at far lower levels.
* Age-specific utilization heatmaps reveal that high-use service categories are concentrated among children, while adults—especially older adults—engage primarily in restorative treatment rather than preventive care.

This suggests that preventive care uptake improves mainly in populations already engaged with the dental system (e.g., children), while adults may continue to use dental services reactively.

**4. Trends suggest alignment between utilization and disease burden**

When comparing California and NHANES:

* Groups with higher disease burden nationally (e.g., school-aged children, adolescents, older adults) correspond to the groups where California's utilization patterns show either high engagement (younger children) or persistent under-engagement (older adults).
* The parallel between rising preventive utilization in CA and declining untreated caries nationally suggests that preventive strategies—including sealants, cleanings, and diagnostic visits—remain central to population-level improvements in oral health.

Yet the disconnect in adult preventive utilization indicates an opportunity for more targeted outreach and policy intervention.

**5. Implications for policy and practice**

The findings collectively highlight:

* **Successful expansion of preventive dental access for children**, consistent with national goals.
* **Ongoing gaps for adolescents and older adults**, both in utilization and disease burden.
* **Need for recovery planning post-COVID**, especially for vulnerable age groups.
* **Importance of preventive interventions**, such as sealants, whose low utilization contrasts with their documented effectiveness (Ng et al., 2023).

These patterns underscore the need for age-tailored strategies and potentially enhanced coverage or outreach programs to reduce disparities and sustain long-term improvements.

Several limitations should be considered when interpreting the findings from this project. These limitations arise from both the structure of the datasets used and the analytic constraints associated with aggregated data.

**1. Use of aggregated administrative data in California**

The California dataset is fully aggregated at the year × age group × service type level. As a result:

* Individual-level variation cannot be analyzed.
* We cannot examine behavioral predictors (e.g., socioeconomic factors, insurance continuity, comorbidities).
* Standard statistical adjustments such as weighting, clustering, or modeling individual heterogeneity are not possible.
* Equity analyses are limited because race/ethnicity and sex variables are not available in the CA administrative dataset.

Therefore, observed patterns reflect population averages and may mask within-group disparities.

**2. Limited time-series resolution and ITS model power**

The interrupted time-series analysis uses annual data, which reduces the sensitivity of the model to detect rapid changes:

* Only **one data point represents the COVID-19 disruption year (2020)**.
* The short series (11 years) limits power to detect slope changes or interaction effects.
* The ITS model estimates directionality but should not be interpreted as causal due to the absence of control groups or monthly/quarterly temporal structure.

Thus, COVID-related effects may be underestimated or imprecisely measured.

**3. NHANES summary tables restrict analytic flexibility**

NHANES data were used in **pre-aggregated form**, which prevents:

* Reapplying survey sampling weights
* Conducting statistical hypothesis tests
* Accounting for stratified sampling
* Adjusting for covariates that influence disease prevalence

Additionally, NHANES summary tables only include selected age groups, preventing full comparability across all life stages.

**4. Temporal misalignment between datasets**

The two datasets cover different time periods:

* California utilization spans **2013–2023**.
* NHANES carries data available to us spanning **1999–2018**.

Because of this mismatch:

* Trends cannot be aligned year-by-year.
* COVID-19 effects cannot be examined in NHANES.
* Comparisons rely on **pattern similarity**, not direct temporal correspondence.

This limits the strength of cross-dataset inferences.

**5. Utilization does not equate to disease burden**

California data measure **service use**, not **oral health outcomes**.
NHANES measures **caries prevalence**, not utilization or access.

Thus:

* High utilization does not necessarily imply improved oral health.
* Low disease burden does not necessarily imply adequate access.

Interpretations linking utilization and disease burden must therefore be made cautiously and contextually.
