## Background & Motivation

Dental caries remains the **most common chronic disease of childhood** in the United States, with progress in prevention being slower among low-income and minority children. Despite the proven effectiveness of preventive measures like dental sealants in reducing pit-and-fissure caries, disparities persist in access to and utilization of these services.

This project aims to bridge the gap between:

- **National oral health surveillance** (NHANES data)
- **State-level preventive service delivery** (California Medi-Cal data)

By integrating these complementary data sources, we assess whether state-level trends in preventive dental service utilization are temporally aligned with national changes in caries burden.


## Research Objectives

Our primary objectives include:

1. **Temporal Trend Analysis**
   - Describe time trends in total and untreated dental caries by age, sex, and race/ethnicity
   - Assess inequality trends across demographic subgroups over two decades

2. **Preventive Care Utilization**
   - Analyze preventive visit and sealant utilization trends (2013–2023) among children and adolescents in California's Medi-Cal program
   - Identify patterns and gaps in service delivery

3. **COVID-19 Impact Assessment**
   - Evaluate pandemic-related disruptions in dental care access using interrupted time-series analysis
   - Quantify the magnitude and duration of service interruptions

4. **Ecological Analysis**
   - Explore temporal associations between California preventive utilization (as a proxy for preventive coverage) and national caries burden
   - Conduct weighted least squares regression accounting for standard errors

## Expected Outcomes

This analysis will produce:

- **Interactive visualizations** showing trends over time
- **Statistical models** quantifying relationships between preventive care and caries burden
- **Policy-relevant insights** for improving oral health equity
- **Reproducible research** via GitHub Pages and R Markdown
